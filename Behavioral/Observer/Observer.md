# Observer (Behavioral)

## Intent

Lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object theyâ€™re observing.

## Motivation

- When changes to the state of one object may require changing other objects, and the actual set of objects is unknown beforehand or changes dynamically.
- When some objects in your app must observe others, but only for a limited time or in specific cases.

## Consequences

- Establish relations between objects during runtime

Cons

- Subscribers are notified in random order
- Difficult to follow control flow
- Hard/Costly to update
